[![Build Status](https://github.com/jgraph/docker-drawio/workflows/Docker%20Image%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jgraph/docker-drawio/actions)


## Introduction

[draw.io](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio) is a whiteboarding / diagramming software application. This project packages draw.io for Docker:

* `jgraph/drawio`, a draw.io docker image that is always up-to-date with draw.io releases
* a [docker-compose](docker-compose.yml) to run draw.io with the Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive and GitLab integrations
* a [docker-compose](nextcloud/) to run draw.io integrated within Nextcloud

The separate export server image (`jgraph/export-server`) has reached end of life and is no longer built or configured by this project, see [Removed variables](#removed-variables).

## Description

The Dockerfile builds from `tomcat:9.0-jdk11-temurin` (see <https://hub.docker.com/_/tomcat/>)

**Note: Starting from version 16.5.3, alpine and debian images are no longer maintained. We changed to a single image that uses the tomcat image with the least security vulnerabilities.**

Forked from [fjudith/draw.io](https://github.com/fjudith/docker-draw.io)

## Features

* Based on Tomcat so it can be used directly or behind a reverse-proxy
* Self-Signed certificate autogen
* Let's encrypt certificate autogen
* Support SSL Keystore mount to `/user/local/tomcat/.keystore`

## Quick Start

Run the container.

```bash
docker run -it --rm --name="draw" -p 8080:8080 -p 8443:8443 jgraph/drawio
```

Start a web browser session to <http://localhost:8080/?offline=1&https=0> or <https://localhost:8443/?offline=1>

If you're running `Docker Toolbox` then start a web browser session to <http://192.168.99.100:8080/?offline=1&https=0> or <https://192.168.99.100:8443/?offline=1>

> `?offline=1` is a security feature that disables support of cloud storage.

## Docker Compose

[`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) runs the same image and passes every `DRAWIO_*` variable listed under [Environment variables](#environment-variables) through from the environment, so the configuration lives in a `.env` file next to it:

```
DRAWIO_SERVER_URL=https://drawio.example.com/
DRAWIO_GITLAB_ID=...
DRAWIO_GITLAB_SECRET=...
DRAWIO_GITLAB_URL=https://gitlab.example.com
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Variables you leave unset are passed through empty, which the image treats as unset.

### AWS ECS

The compose file can be deployed to AWS ECS by following this [tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-cli-tutorial-ec2.html) (we recommend EC2 deployment). Change the port mapping to 80 and 443 in `docker-compose.yml` to support the standard HTTP and HTTPS ports, allow access to these ports in the security group inbound rules, and set `DRAWIO_SERVER_URL` to your public deployment URL.

## Running as a non-root user

The image already runs as a dedicated non-root user by default — `tomcat` (UID `1001`, GID `999`) — so nothing needs to be configured just to avoid root.

[Users have reported](https://github.com/jgraph/docker-drawio/issues/210) it working with [rootless] Podman, but we haven't tested ourselves.

To run under a *different* UID (a compose `user:` override, Kubernetes `runAsUser`, or OpenShift's arbitrary UIDs), the user must carry the **root group (GID `0`)**. Configuration is applied at startup by rewriting files inside the container ([`main/docker-entrypoint.sh`](main/docker-entrypoint.sh)), and the image grants GID `0` owner-equivalent permissions on those paths, following the OpenShift image guidelines. Membership of group `0` grants no other privileges — it is not root.

```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 --user 1234:0 jgraph/drawio
```

docker-compose — either set group `0` directly or keep your own GID and add it as a supplementary group:

```yaml
services:
  drawio:
    image: jgraph/drawio
    user: "1234:1234"
    group_add:
      - "0"
```

Kubernetes:

```yaml
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 1234
  runAsGroup: 0        # or keep your own runAsGroup and add supplementalGroups: [0]
```

On OpenShift, restricted SCCs already run pods with an arbitrary UID and GID `0`, so the image works there without any extra configuration.

Without GID `0` the container still starts, but the entrypoint logs a warning and skips all runtime configuration (`DRAWIO_*` variables, SSL, context path).

> `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true` is not currently supported, since configuration is written into the webapp at startup.

## Environment variables

All container behaviour is controlled by environment variables, processed by [`main/docker-entrypoint.sh`](main/docker-entrypoint.sh) at startup and written into `PreConfig.js` / `PostConfig.js` inside the deployed webapp.

### Certificate and SSL

| Variable               | Default                    | Description                                              |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LETS_ENCRYPT_ENABLED` | `false`                    | Enables Let's Encrypt certificate instead of self-signed |
| `PUBLIC_DNS`           | `draw.example.com`         | DNS domain to be used as certificate "CN" record         |
| `ORGANISATION_UNIT`    | `Cloud Native Application` | Organisation unit to be used as certificate "OU" record  |
| `ORGANISATION`         | `example inc`              | Organisation name to be used as certificate "O" record   |
| `CITY`                 | `Paris`                    | City name to be used as certificate "L" record           |
| `STATE`                | `Paris`                    | State name to be used as certificate "ST" record         |
| `COUNTRY_CODE`         | `FR`                       | Country code to be used as certificate "C" record        |
| `KEYSTORE_PASS`        | `V3ry1nS3cur3P4ssw0rd`     | `.keystore` / `.jks` store password                      |
| `KEY_PASS`             | same as `KEYSTORE_PASS`    | Private key password                                     |

### Deployment URL

* **DRAWIO_SERVER_URL**: Public deployment URL **with a trailing slash**, e.g. `https://drawio.example.com/`, or `https://www.example.com/drawio/` if deployed into a sub-path. When a sub-path is present the entrypoint also updates the Tomcat context path automatically. Default unset (the webapp is served at `/`).
* **DRAWIO_BASE_URL**: (Optional, backwards-compat) Same URL **without** a trailing slash, used by the viewer/lightbox/embed code paths. Only needed if `DRAWIO_SERVER_URL` is not set; the entrypoint derives whichever one is missing. If both are set, both pass through unchanged.
* **DRAWIO_VIEWER_URL**: Optional URL of a hosted viewer JS bundle, e.g. `https://drawio.example.com/js/viewer.min.js`.
* **DRAWIO_LIGHTBOX_URL**: Optional lightbox URL, e.g. `https://drawio.example.com`.
* **DRAWIO_USE_HTTP**: (Optional and INSECURE) If your setup uses http only and you understand the risks (for example, sending OAuth tokens over http), set `DRAWIO_USE_HTTP=1`. **Caution: Use at your own risk**.

### Editor configuration

* **DRAWIO_CONFIG**: JSON configuration object for the diagram editor — written verbatim into `window.DRAWIO_CONFIG`. See <https://www.drawio.com/doc/faq/configure-diagram-editor>. Must be valid JSON, not arbitrary JavaScript, and must be the JSON itself, not the path of a file (see `DRAWIO_CONFIG_FILE`). The entrypoint logs a warning at startup when the value does not parse as JSON. In a compose file use the map syntax, `DRAWIO_CONFIG: '{"defaultFonts":["Helvetica"]}'` — with the list syntax (`- DRAWIO_CONFIG='{...}'`) the quotes become part of the value and the editor ignores it (the entrypoint strips a matching pair of single quotes and logs a notice).
* **DRAWIO_CONFIG_FILE**: Path inside the container of a file holding that same JSON object, for a bind mount or a Kubernetes ConfigMap. Takes precedence over `DRAWIO_CONFIG` when both are set. For example:

  ```bash
  docker run -p 8080:8080 -v ./drawio-config.json:/config/drawio-config.json:ro -e DRAWIO_CONFIG_FILE=/config/drawio-config.json jgraph/drawio
  ```

* **DRAWIO_LANG**: Default language of the editor UI as a draw.io language code, e.g. `es`, `de` or `pt-br` (the codes behind the editor's *Language* menu). Used when the URL has no `lang` parameter and the user has not picked a language in the editor; both of those still win. Unset = browser language. There is no language key in `DRAWIO_CONFIG`.
* **DRAWIO_CSP_HEADER**: Override the default Content-Security-Policy `<meta>` injected into the page. Defaults to a hard-coded policy in [`docker-entrypoint.sh`](main/docker-entrypoint.sh) — start from that policy when customising.
* **ENABLE_DRAWIO_PROXY**: Set to `1` to enable the `/proxy` endpoint (ProxyServlet) which allows embedding images from external URLs; default disabled.

**Enabling AI diagram generation:** the AI options (`enableAi`, `gptApiKey`, `geminiApiKey`, `claudeApiKey`, `aiModels`, `aiConfigs`, ...) are editor configuration settings, not standalone environment variables — there is no `DRAWIO_ENABLE_AI`. Set them inside `DRAWIO_CONFIG`, for example:

```bash
DRAWIO_CONFIG={"enableAi":true,"claudeApiKey":"sk-ant-...","aiModels":[{"name":"Claude 4.5 Sonnet","model":"claude-sonnet-4-5","config":"claude"}]}
```

`enableAi` defaults to `true` only on app.diagrams.net, and the custom AI actions only appear once an API key and model are configured, so a self-hosted deployment needs both `enableAi: true` **and** a key. See [Customise LLM backends for diagram generation](https://www.drawio.com/doc/faq/configure-ai-options) for the full list of options.

### Custom fonts

The editor renders text in the user's browser, which can only use fonts installed on the viewer's device or loaded over HTTP(S) — mounting font files into this container does **not** make them appear in the editor. Make a web font selectable in the font picker with `defaultFonts` (or `customFonts`, which prepends to the list) inside `DRAWIO_CONFIG`:

```bash
DRAWIO_CONFIG={"defaultFonts":["Helvetica",{"fontFamily":"My Font","fontUrl":"https://drawio.example.com/fonts/MyFont.woff2"}]}
```

Plain string entries must be installed on every viewer's device; entries with `fontFamily` + `fontUrl` (a direct font file or a Google-Fonts-style CSS URL) are downloaded by the browser, and the URL is stored in the diagram so other viewers and exports can resolve it — use an absolute URL reachable from every browser that will open the diagram. To serve font files from this container, mount them into the webapp: `-v ./fonts:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/draw/fonts` serves them at `https://your-host/fonts/…`.

`fontCss` (also inside `DRAWIO_CONFIG`) injects raw `@font-face` rules; it makes text using that family render, but does **not** add anything to the font picker — combine it with a plain font name in `defaultFonts`/`customFonts`, or just use a `fontUrl` entry instead. The default CSP allows fonts from any origin (`font-src *`); if you override **DRAWIO_CSP_HEADER**, keep your font host allowed there.

See the draw.io documentation on [external fonts](https://www.drawio.com/docs/manual/text/external-fonts/) for how fonts behave in the editor itself.

### Google Drive integration

Create a project at the [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis) and create [Credentials](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials) of type "Create OAuth client ID" -> Web Application. This option is disabled until you create the "OAuth consent screen" from the link in the warning message bar; there, enter the "Application name" and "Authorized domains". In the "Create OAuth client ID" configuration, set "Authorized redirect URIs" to `[your-draw.io-hostname]/google` and "Authorized JavaScript origins" to your hostname. For example, if you host draw.io at `https://drawio.example.com`, the redirect URI is `https://drawio.example.com/google` and the JavaScript origin is `https://drawio.example.com`.

* **DRAWIO_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID**: OAuth client ID. Unset = Google Drive integration disabled.
* **DRAWIO_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET**: OAuth client secret.
* **DRAWIO_GOOGLE_APP_ID**: Google project number (the numeric prefix of the client ID, before the first `-`). For example, if the client ID is `123456789-abc...`, the app ID is `123456789`.
* **DRAWIO_GOOGLE_VIEWER_CLIENT_ID** / **DRAWIO_GOOGLE_VIEWER_CLIENT_SECRET** / **DRAWIO_GOOGLE_VIEWER_APP_ID**: Optional separate read-only credentials for a viewer deployment. If you also host a draw.io viewer, create another client ID for it; the viewer has read-only access to Drive files.

### Microsoft OneDrive integration

Register an application to use the MS Graph APIs, see [how to register your app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2) and [how to use the APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/use-the-api). In the Azure portal select the new app, then "Authentication", and add two redirect URIs: `[your-draw.io-hostname]/microsoft` and `[your-draw.io-hostname]/onedrive3.html`. For example, if you host draw.io at `https://drawio.example.com`, the redirect URIs are `https://drawio.example.com/microsoft` and `https://drawio.example.com/onedrive3.html`. In "Advanced settings" on the same page, enable the "Access tokens" and "ID tokens" check boxes. Create the client secret under "Certificates & secrets" ("+ New client secret"); the "Application (client) ID" is on the "Overview" page.

* **DRAWIO_MSGRAPH_CLIENT_ID**: Azure app client ID. Unset = OneDrive integration disabled.
* **DRAWIO_MSGRAPH_CLIENT_SECRET**: Azure app client secret.
* **DRAWIO_MSGRAPH_TENANT_ID**: Tenant ID for single-tenant Azure apps.

### GitLab integration

Create a new OAuth app in GitLab (Settings -> Applications). Set the "Redirect URI" to `[your-draw.io-hostname]/gitlab`, e.g. `https://drawio.example.com/gitlab`, and the "Scopes" to `api`, `read_repository` and `write_repository`.

* **DRAWIO_GITLAB_ID**: OAuth application ID. Unset = GitLab integration disabled.
* **DRAWIO_GITLAB_SECRET**: OAuth application secret.
* **DRAWIO_GITLAB_URL**: GitLab base URL **without** any path, e.g. `https://gitlab.com` or `https://gitlab.example.com`. The entrypoint appends `/oauth/token` itself for server-side auth, and uses this value as the base of the client-side `/oauth/authorize` URL — adding a path here breaks both. When this is set to anything other than `https://gitlab.com` the entrypoint also writes `Editor.enableCustomGitLabUrl = true;` into `PostConfig.js`, which is required by the client to allow self-hosted instances; without it the OAuth flow fails with an "access denied" dialog before any request is made.

### Removed variables

* **EXPORT_URL** and **DRAWIO_SELF_CONTAINED** no longer have any effect. They pointed the editor at the separate `jgraph/export-server` image, which has reached end of life and is no longer built from this repository.

## HTTPS SSL Certificate via Let's Encrypt

### Prerequisites:

1. A Linux machine connected to the Internet with ports 443 and 80 open
1. A domain/subdomain name pointing to this machine's IP address. (e.g., drawio.example.com)

### Method:

1. Create a directory to store the letsencrypt data. (e.g., /opt/docker/drawiodata/letsencrypt-log, /opt/docker/drawiodata/letsencrypt-etc, /opt/docker/drawiodata/letsencrypt-lib)
2. Using jgraph/drawio docker image, run the following command
```bash
docker run -it -m1g -v "/opt/docker/drawiodata/letsencrypt-log:/var/log/letsencrypt/" -v "/opt/docker/drawiodata/letsencrypt-etc:/etc/letsencrypt/" -v "/opt/docker/drawiodata/letsencrypt-lib:/var/lib/letsencrypt" -e LETS_ENCRYPT_ENABLED=true -e PUBLIC_DNS=drawio.example.com --rm --name="draw" -p 80:80 -p 443:8443 jgraph/drawio
```
Notice that mapping port 80 to container's port 80 allows certbot to work in stand-alone mode. Mapping port 443 to container's port 8443 allows the container tomcat to serve https requests directly.
